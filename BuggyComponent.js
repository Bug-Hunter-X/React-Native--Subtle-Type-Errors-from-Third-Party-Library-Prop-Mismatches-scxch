This error occurs when using a third-party library that expects a specific type for a prop but receives a different type. For example, if a component expects a string prop but receives a number, you'll get a runtime error. This error is often subtle, as TypeScript might not catch it, especially when dealing with dynamic data or implicit type conversions.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
<MyComponent someProp={123} />

// Correct usage
<MyComponent someProp="123" />
```
